## Description

**BFAST Explorer** is a [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app, developed using R and Python, designed for the analysis of *Landsat Surface Reflectance* time series pixel data.

Three change detection algorithms - **bfastmonitor**, **bfast01** and **bfast** - are used in order to investigate temporal changes in trend and seasonal components, via breakpoint detection.

If you encounter any bugs, please create an [issue](https://github.com/almeidaxan/bfast-explorer/issues) or send a message to almeida.xan@gmail.com.
